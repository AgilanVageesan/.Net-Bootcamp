# JWT Authentication and User Verification for Banking API

In this documentation, we will cover the implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and user verification in the Banking API. JWT authentication is a widely used method to secure APIs and ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access specific endpoints.

## What is JWT Authentication?

JWT is a compact and self-contained way of representing information between parties as a JSON object. It can be used to authenticate and securely transmit information between parties. In the context of web APIs, JWT is commonly used to authenticate users and provide them with access tokens.

A JWT token consists of three parts: the header, the payload (claims), and the signature. The header typically contains information about the token's type and signing algorithm. The payload contains claims, which are statements about the user. The signature is used to verify the integrity of the token.

## User Verification with Bank Account Number

In the Banking API, we will use the bank account number as one of the claims in the JWT token. When a user logs in, they will provide their bank account number and a password. The API will verify the bank account number and password against a user database to authenticate the user.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Configure JWT Authentication**: In the `Startup.cs` file, configure JWT authentication middleware. Set the token key, signing algorithm, and other authentication options.

2. **Create a User Database**: Implement a user database to store user information, including the bank account number and password. You can use ASP.NET Core Identity or any other user management system.

3. **User Authentication**: When a user logs in, verify their bank account number and password against the user database. If the credentials are correct, generate a JWT token and return it to the user.

4. **JWT Token Generation**: Generate a JWT token containing the user's bank account number and other necessary claims. Sign the token with the token key and return it to the user.

5. **Use JWT Token in API Requests**: On the client-side, store the JWT token securely (e.g., in memory, local storage, or a cookie). Include the token in the `Authorization` header of subsequent API requests to authenticate the user.

## Example Code

Here's a simplified example of how to implement JWT authentication and user verification in the Banking API. Please note that this is a basic outline, and you may need to implement additional security measures and error handling in a production environment.

```csharp
// Sample code for user authentication and token generation (using ASP.NET Core Identity and JWT)

// AuthenticationService.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
using System;
using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Text;

public class AuthenticationService
{
    private readonly UserManager<ApplicationUser> _userManager;
    private readonly string _tokenKey;

    public AuthenticationService(UserManager<ApplicationUser> userManager, string tokenKey)
    {
        _userManager = userManager;
        _tokenKey = tokenKey;
    }

    public async Task<string> AuthenticateAndGetJwtToken(string accountNumber, string password)
    {
        // Authenticate the user using the bank account number and password
        var user = await _userManager.FindByBankAccountNumberAsync(accountNumber);
        if (user == null || !await _userManager.CheckPasswordAsync(user, password))
        {
            throw new AuthenticationException("Invalid bank account number or password.");
        }

        // Generate and return JWT token
        return GenerateJwtToken(user);
    }

    private string GenerateJwtToken(ApplicationUser user)
    {
        var tokenHandler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler();
        var key = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_tokenKey);
        var signingCredentials = new SigningCredentials(new SymmetricSecurityKey(key), SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256);

        var tokenDescriptor = new SecurityTokenDescriptor
        {
            Subject = new ClaimsIdentity(new[]
            {
                new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, user.Id),
                new Claim("AccountNumber", user.AccountNumber),
                // Add additional claims here if needed (e.g., roles, custom claims)
            }),
            Expires = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(7), // Set token expiration (adjust as needed)
            SigningCredentials = signingCredentials
        };

        var token = tokenHandler.CreateToken(tokenDescriptor);
        return tokenHandler.WriteToken(token);
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a service called `AuthenticationService`, which handles user authentication and token generation. The `AuthenticateAndGetJwtToken` method takes the bank account number and password as input and verifies them against the user database using ASP.NET Core Identity. If the credentials are correct, the method generates a JWT token containing the user's bank account number as a claim.

Please note that this is just a simplified example, and in a real-world application, you may need to handle additional aspects, such as token refresh, token revocation, and more robust error handling. Also, ensure that the `tokenKey` value is securely stored and never exposed to unauthorized users.
