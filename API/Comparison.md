# Comparison of REST API, SOAP, and Kafka

## 1. REST API
**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style used for designing networked applications. REST APIs communicate over HTTP, and they use standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform operations on resources. Data is typically exchanged in formats like JSON or XML.

### Advantages:
- Simple and lightweight.
- Easy to understand and implement.
- Wide support for various programming languages and frameworks.
- Stateless nature allows for scalability and easier caching.

### Disadvantages:
- Lack of formal contract or standardized communication.
- Limited support for built-in security features.
- Can become less efficient with complex and resource-intensive operations.

### History of Origin:
RESTful principles were introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000.

### Limitations:
- Lacks standardized security features like WS-Security in SOAP.
- Not suitable for scenarios requiring complex transactions and ACID guarantees.

### Real-time Use Case - Biryani Shop Example:
A REST API for a Biryani shop could have endpoints like:
- `GET /menu`: Retrieves the list of available biryani types.
- `GET /menu/{id}`: Retrieves details of a specific biryani by ID.
- `POST /order`: Places an order for biryani.

## 2. SOAP
**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)** is a messaging protocol used for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It relies on XML for message format and HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc., for message transmission.

### Advantages:
- Strong standardized protocol with built-in security (WS-Security).
- Formal contract through Web Services Definition Language (WSDL).
- Support for ACID transactions.

### Disadvantages:
- Heavy and complex due to XML-based messaging.
- Slower compared to REST due to the XML overhead.
- Less human-readable than JSON-based formats.

### History of Origin:
SOAP was first introduced in 1998 by Dave Winer, Don Box, Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein.

### Limitations:
- Higher complexity makes it harder to implement and maintain.
- Not as widely supported by modern systems compared to REST.

### Real-time Use Case - Biryani Shop Example:
A SOAP-based API for a Biryani shop could use WSDL to define service operations like:
- `GetMenu`: Retrieves the list of available biryani types.
- `GetBiryaniDetails`: Retrieves details of a specific biryani by ID.
- `PlaceOrder`: Places an order for biryani.

## 3. Kafka
**Kafka** is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and real-time data streaming applications. It acts as a message broker, enabling communication between applications using publish-subscribe mechanisms.

### Advantages:
- High throughput and low latency, ideal for real-time data streaming.
- Horizontal scalability and fault-tolerance.
- Efficient handling of large volumes of data.

### Disadvantages:
- More complex to set up and manage compared to REST and SOAP.
- Requires additional components for full functionality (Zookeeper for coordination).

### History of Origin:
Kafka was developed by LinkedIn and later open-sourced as an Apache project in 2011.

### Limitations:
- Not suitable for request-response patterns like REST and SOAP.
- May lead to increased network usage due to constant streaming of events.

### Real-time Use Case - Biryani Shop Example:
Imagine the biryani shop wants to implement a real-time notification system to inform customers about their order status. Kafka can be used here to publish events like:
- `OrderPlaced`: Triggered when a new order is placed.
- `OrderInPreparation`: Triggered when the chef starts preparing the biryani.
- `OrderReadyForPickup`: Triggered when the biryani is ready for pickup/delivery.

Customers who subscribed to these events will be notified in real-time about their order status.

## C#/.NET Code Examples:

### REST API (ASP.NET Web API):

```csharp
// Define a model for Biryani
public class Biryani
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    // Other properties...
}

// BiryaniController.cs
public class BiryaniController : ApiController
{
    // GET api/biryani
    public IEnumerable<Biryani> Get()
    {
        // Return the list of biryanis from the database
    }

    // GET api/biryani/{id}
    public Biryani Get(int id)
    {
        // Return a specific biryani by ID from the database
    }

    // POST api/biryani
    public void Post([FromBody] Biryani biryani)
    {
        // Save the new biryani to the database
    }
}
```

### SOAP Web Service (ASP.NET Web Services):

```csharp
// Define a model for Biryani
public class Biryani
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    // Other properties...
}

[WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)]
public class BiryaniService : System.Web.Services.WebService
{
    [WebMethod]
    public Biryani GetBiryaniById(int id)
    {
        // Retrieve a specific biryani by ID from the database
    }

    [WebMethod]
    public void PlaceOrder(Biryani biryani)
    {
        // Place an order for the specified biryani
    }
}
```

```csharp
using Confluent.Kafka;

public class BiryaniProducer
{
    private readonly ProducerConfig config;
    private readonly string topicName;

    public BiryaniProducer(string bootstrapServers, string topicName)
    {


        this.topicName = topicName;
        config = new ProducerConfig { BootstrapServers = bootstrapServers };
    }

    public async Task ProduceBiryaniEventAsync(Biryani biryani)
    {
        using (var producer = new ProducerBuilder<Null, string>(config).Build())
        {
            var message = new Message<Null, string>
            {
                Value = JsonSerializer.Serialize(biryani) // Convert Biryani object to JSON
            };

            var deliveryReport = await producer.ProduceAsync(topicName, message);
            // Handle delivery report if needed
        }
    }
}
```
